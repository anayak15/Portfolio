      <h4>Bio</h4>
      <p>
       Hi! I am Ankita Nayak. I am an incoming junior at Dougherty Valley High School. I do taekwondo, a type of martial art. I am a second degree black belt. I love competing at tournements for taekwondo. I enjoy reading. Whenver I have the time, I pick up a book and start to read.

     <h4>Circuit</h4>

      <br>
      The most complicated circuit my group and I were able to construct is the one shown in the picture. When you press the button, both of the LEDs light up. Some of the bumps we faced was trying to get both of the LEDs to light up. With the help of our classmates we were able to fix this by placing the LEDs parallel. This way both of the LEDs are connected to a jumper wire and a resistor. Working in a group is really nice. We were able to give our opinions regarding the problems we faced and came up with solutions to fix them together.

     <h4>Light Show</h4>

     <br>
     My group and I tried to make the four LEDs blink one after another. This we were able to complete successfully. From today's project I was able to learn many new things. Some of them are how to use arrays and for loops in c++. Both help to simplify the code. I also learned that there different types of resistors. Some allow the LEDs to glow brightly while others don't. Overall, this is a very fun project.

     <h4>Escape Bot</h4>
     <img src = "escapeBot.jpg" style="width:340px;height:228px;">
     <br>
     From this escape bot project, I learned how the Arduino sensors work and how to control them. My group went through a whole trial-and-error process. We had to try different ways to get the robot to go through the obstacle course. We were able to make it turn left but not right. Overall, we were able to copperate and had fun while trying to figure out the problems we faced along the way.
