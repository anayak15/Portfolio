       <li> Similarites in Python and Scratch are that both contain variables, loops, pen statements, user inputs, etc. A difference is that in Python today the loop that we learned was a 'for' loop, which is a little different from the repeat block in Scratch. But both execute similarly.</li>
       <li> Debugging was nice, especially the feeling once you it right. From debugging, I was able to catch on to my mistakes and not make them again. At times though it was hard to figure out what to do, but the python interpreter notifies you of what needs to be fixed.</li>

      The most complicated circuit my group and I were ale to construct is the one shown in the picture. When you press the button, both of the LEDs light up. Some of the bumps we faced was trying to get both of the LEDs to light up. With the help of our classmates we were able to fix this by placing the LEDs parallel. This way both of the LEDs are connected to a jumper wire and a resistor. Working in a group is really nice. We were able to give our opinions regarding the problems we faced and came up with solutions to fix them together.
