       Hi! I am Ankita Nayak. I am an incoming junior at Dougherty Valley High School. I do taekwondo, a type of martial art. I am a second degree black belt. I love competing at tournements for taekwondo. I enjoy reading. Whenver I have the time, I pick up a book and start to read.

       <li> Similarites in Python and Scratch are that both contain variables, loops, pen statements, user inputs, etc. A difference is that in Python today the loop that we learned was a 'for' loop, which is a little different from the repeat block in Scratch. BUt both execute similarly.</li>
       <li> Debugging was nice, especially the feeling once you it right. From debugging, I was able to catch on to my mistakes and not make them again. At times though it was hard to figure out what to do, but the python interpreter notifies you of what needs to be fixed.</li>
